About the pinball championship, i think that could be the starting of a new era for Blackcoin.
I was thinking on a secure blackcoin web explorer with VPN and a native BLK web wallet incorporated. 
The idea of the pinball championship is to create a movement here in argentina where the participants needs a BLK wallet and some BLKs to participate. A wallet that accept all the inscriptions and then distribute when championship ends. So... all the funds move clearly and transparent on the BLK blockchain. Like a welcome to new members.
We are 2 persons generating this movement and we want to generate one championship a month, maybe twice.
If any developer could help to create the secure BLK brownser where we could track the championship and follow it in real time with a couple of cams, we could generate a bets platform to interact with the championship event too.
I was watching 2 projects. Brave brownser with BAT token and Theta network with Theta and T-fuel (theta.tv)
Brave brownser have its own token wich is distribuited with users who choose to watch some advertisements. User navigate the web and see some advertisements, user win some BATS.
Theta.tv has a distribution a bit more complex but... theta.tv as a streaming platform, distribute the secondary token of the project, T-Fuel with users that create online streaming events and with people that watch some of that events too. 
So... having that in mind, we could build a secure private brownser to follow the pinball championship event and take some bets on it on top of the Blackcoin blockchain.
We coud generate a token on top of Blackcoin to distribute with users that uses the BLK brownser and interact with our events or contents.
I could write a posible distribution for that token trying to create one fairy as possible. With this token we would have a secondary economy to have funds to paid work, estimule users, marketing campains and a posible pre sale too.
Blackcoin would be a kind of BNB where you would need some BLKs to could moove the token between wallets and pay the transactions fee. There would be a usability for BLK.
Then, the Pinball championship format could be tested on a lot of kind of different events.
I like the Extreme Sports and extreme games to focus and put the same pinball Champ format on but could fit at every event
