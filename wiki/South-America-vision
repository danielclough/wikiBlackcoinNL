Here in Argentina Im am working with Arts and diferents communities as an identity. 
Music, video Clips, pinball, paint, tatoos, weed, FX Makeup, bikes, and could be a lot of more.
is like open the frontiers to the average world human. As bridges from the analog to the digital world. Like crooschains. interoperability.
I am sure that if more people is envolved, better distribution is. People need to feel identified with to want to be part of.
I am working with my community here and I would love to see some coins to distribute here to people that interact with. It feel much better than an airdrop. Like support artist to let them do that they love do. Entusiasm as a north, Art. That kind of things that goverments not support.
art is a capacity that machines dont have. so estimulate and be identified with is a real bussiness to people get identified with.
Art is everywhere.
Time is not money, time is art. art that real people do and you could get feel identified with.
